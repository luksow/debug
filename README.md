debug
=====

debug is simple, single-file debug toolkit for C/C++.

Description
-----------

debug provides macros that allows inspection of program state during
execution by printfing to stderr some desired info.

Usage
-----

Include debug.h and you are ready to go! Use macros as shown in the samples.c
file. You can disable toolkit effects (no printfs, zero overhead) by defining
standard NDEBUG during compilation.
